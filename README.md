#### 1. Get Required Files
Clone this repository locally to the same directory as your `home.nix` (in `/etc/nixos/`). For example,

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ configuration.nix
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hardware-configuration.nix
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ home.nix
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ nautilus-exif # Create this directory
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ default.nix
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ nautilus-exif.py
```

#### 2. Modify your `home.nix`

```nix
{ inputs, lib, config, pkgs,  ... }:
let
  # Import package
  nautilus-exif = import ./nautilus-exif { inherit pkgs; };
  ...
in {
  home.packages = (with pkgs; [
    # Add to packages
    nautilus-exif
    ...
  ]);
  # Use new version of `Nautilus` for desktop
  xdg.desktopEntries."org.gnome.Nautilus" = {
    name = "Files";
    comment = "Access and organize files";
    terminal = false;
    type = "Application";
    exec = "${nautilus-exif}/bin/nautilus --new-window %U";
    startupNotify = true;
    icon = "org.gnome.Nautilus";
    categories = ["GNOME" "GTK" "Utility" "Core" "FileManager"];
    mimeType = ["inode/directory" "application/x-7z-compressed" "application/x-7z-compressed-tar" "application/x-bzip" "application/x-bzip-compressed-tar" "application/x-compress" "application/x-compressed-tar" "application/x-cpio" "application/x-gzip" "application/x-lha" "application/x-lzip" "application/x-lzip-compressed-tar" "application/x-lzma" "application/x-lzma-compressed-tar" "application/x-tar" "application/x-tarz" "application/x-xar" "application/x-xz" "application/x-xz-compressed-tar" "application/zip" "application/gzip" "application/bzip2" "application/x-bzip2-compressed-tar" "application/vnd.rar" "application/zstd" "application/x-zstd-compressed-tar"];
    actions."new-window" = {
      name = "New Window";
      exec = "${nautilus-exif}/bin/nautilus --new-window";
    };
  };
}
```

#### 3. Restart Nautilus
Kill Nautilus with `nautilus -q`, and re-open the app. You may need to log out and log back in for the new launcher to take effect.

#### 4. Enable EXIF Columns
Go to List View in Nautilus, and at the drop down menu select `Visible Columns`. From here you can enable new columns from EXIF information

## üí≥ About & Credits
This project is based on @Hekel1989's [nautilus-extra-columns](https://github.com/Hekel1989/nautilus-extra-columns). However as the original project ceases development and doesn't work anymore with the GTK4 Nautilus, this project is created to add more features while ensuring compatibility. Although I probably wouldn't be updating this project too often, constructive issue reports, features suggestions and pull requests are very welcome.

This project wouldn't be here without:
* [`nautilus-extra-columns`](https://github.com/Hekel1989/nautilus-extra-columns) - The original project
* [`py3exiv2`](https://launchpad.net/py3exiv2) - For enabling reading the EXIF tags
* [`reverse-geocode`](https://github.com/richardpenman/reverse_geocode/) - For enabling offline reverse geocoding
* Authors of GNOME Files (`nautilus`)
